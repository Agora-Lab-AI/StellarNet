StellarNet: An AI system probing the possibility that stars may possess primitive forms of information processing. By analyzing complex patterns in stellar emissions using deep learning, we search for signatures of self-organization and structured behavior that transcend random processes.


## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive analysis pipeline for investigating potential "consciousness-like" patterns in stellar data using PyTorch and astronomical data from TESS and Kepler missions.


## Features

- üî¨ Real-time analysis of stellar light curves from TESS/Kepler missions
- üß† LSTM-based pattern detection for stellar behavior prediction
- üìä Comprehensive entropy and frequency analysis
- üîç Anomaly detection in stellar emissions
- üìà Advanced visualization of stellar patterns

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Agora-Lab-AI/StellarNet.git
cd StellarNet

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the script analyzes a set of pre-selected variable stars. To analyze specific stars:

```bash
python main.py --star_id "TIC 260128333" --mission "TESS"
```


## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch
- lightkurve
- astropy
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

See `requirements.txt` for complete list.

## Methodology

Our analysis pipeline consists of several key components:

1. **Data Collection**: Automated fetching of stellar light curves from TESS/Kepler missions
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalization of time-series data
3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Shannon entropy calculation
   - Fourier analysis
   - LSTM-based pattern prediction
   - Anomaly detection
4. **Visualization**: Comprehensive plotting of results

## Results

Analysis results are saved in the `results/` directory with the following structure:
- `{star_id}_analysis.npz`: Numerical results and statistics
- `{star_id}_plots.png`: Visualization plots
- `models/{star_id}_model.pt`: Trained LSTM model
